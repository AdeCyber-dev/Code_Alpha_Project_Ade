# Code Alpha Project Ade

This repository contains my projects for the Code Alpha cybersecurity internship program. The tasks in this program help to develop skills in various aspects of cybersecurity.

## Projects Included

1. **Network Sniffer**  
   - A Python-based tool to capture and analyze network traffic.  
   - The project demonstrates how data flows through a network and decodes network packets for analysis.

2. **Secure Coding Review**  
   - A Flask web app and API were developed.
   - The code was analyzed using the Bandit static analyzer for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and hardcoded credentials.
   - Recommendations for secure coding practices were provided.

3. **Network Intrusion Detection System**  
   - Configured a network-based intrusion detection system using tools like Snort/Suricata.
   - Developed custom rules to detect and visualize suspicious activity.
